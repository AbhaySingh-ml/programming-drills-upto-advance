# 🧠 Programming Drills – Custom Python Practice

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook (`drills.ipynb`) featuring a series of custom-designed programming drill questions and solutions written in Python.

These questions are designed by me (Abhay) to build strong programming logic and prepare for LeetCode Easy/Medium-level problems.

## 📘 Notebook Structure

The notebook includes:
- Problem statements (formatted in Markdown cells)
- Step-by-step solutions with code
- Comments explaining the logic
- Covers various topics like:
  - Variables & Loops
  - Conditions
  - Strings & Lists
  - Prefix Sums
  - Recursion (coming soon)

---

## 📌 Why This Exists

- To document my learning journey
- To reinforce core concepts and logic
- To help others who are starting out with programming fundamentals

---

## 📥 How to Use

1. Clone this repo or download the notebook:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/programming-drills.git

2. Open `drills.ipynb` using Jupyter or VS Code
3. Read the question → Try solving → Refer to solution if needed

## ✅ Coming Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels
- Add output screenshots
- Add more advanced drills
- Split into topic-wise folders (optional)
